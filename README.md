## Getting started

### Dependencies

Dependencies are handled automatically by the [dependencycheck](https://github.com/explowz/cathook/blob/master/scripts/dependencycheck) script.

### Downloading

Open a terminal window and enter the following command:

    bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/explowz/One-in-all-cathook-install/master/install-all)

The `cathook` folder should have been created successfully, containing all source files.

### Compiling from source

When you have obtained a copy of the source code, the next step is opening it with your IDE of choice.

Then change all `-march=native -mtune=native` arguments inside [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/explowz/cathook/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) to `-march=<your cpu-type> -mtune=<your cpu-type>`. This should result in more performant code, optimized for your CPU. The list of valid options can be found [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/x86-Options.html).

And simply run the following command while inside the source folder:

    ./update

If everything went right you should receive a binary file named `libcathook.so`.

### Loading / Injecting into game process

Run the following command while inside the source folder:

    sudo ./attach

This will inject `libcathook.so` into the `hl2_linux` process.

When injected, the menu can be opened using the `INSERT` key.

## FAQ

### How do I open the menu?
Press <kbd>INSERT</kbd> while focused on the TF2 window.

### Where is my config file saved?
Configuration files are saved inside the `cathook` folder located in your `opt` folder (`/opt/cathook/data`). The config is in human-readable format and can be edited via your text editor of choice.
